# AWS Learning Platform Implementation Details

## Language Choice: Java
Java was chosen for this project for the following reasons:
•⁠  ⁠*Strong OOP Support*: Java's robust object-oriented features perfectly match our complex domain model
•⁠  ⁠*Type Safety*: Static typing helps catch errors at compile time
•⁠  ⁠*Enterprise Standard*: Widely used in enterprise applications
•⁠  ⁠*Rich Ecosystem*: Extensive libraries and frameworks available
•⁠  ⁠*Cross-Platform*: Runs on any platform with JVM

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Package Structure

com.awslearning/ ├── enums/ # Enumerated types for status and roles ├── models/ # Core domain models └── Main.java # Test implementation


### 2. Class Design Principles
•⁠  ⁠*Encapsulation*: Private attributes with getter/setter methods
•⁠  ⁠*Single Responsibility*: Each class has a specific purpose
•⁠  ⁠*Composition*: Course contains Lessons, Lessons contain Content
•⁠  ⁠*Clean Code*: Meaningful naming conventions and clear method signatures

### 3. Implementation Details
#### Enums
•⁠  ⁠⁠ AccountStatus ⁠: Manages user account states
•⁠  ⁠⁠ ContentType ⁠: Defines types of learning content
•⁠  ⁠⁠ CourseStatus ⁠: Tracks course publication status
•⁠  ⁠⁠ UserRole ⁠: Defines user access levels

#### Core Models
•⁠  ⁠⁠ User ⁠: Manages user information and authentication
•⁠  ⁠⁠ Course ⁠: Handles course structure and content
•⁠  ⁠⁠ Lesson ⁠: Organizes learning materials
•⁠  ⁠⁠ Content ⁠: Manages different types of learning content
•⁠  ⁠⁠ Quiz ⁠: Handles assessment components
•⁠  ⁠⁠ Progress ⁠: Tracks user advancement

### 4. Testing
Implementation verified through Main.java test cases demonstrating:
•⁠  ⁠User creation and management
•⁠  ⁠Course creation and enrollment
•⁠  ⁠Lesson and content management
