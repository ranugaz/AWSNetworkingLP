## Kanban Board Explanation

A Kanban board is a visual management tool that helps our team organize, track, and optimize our workflow for developing the AWS Networking Services Learning Platform. Our board is designed to enhance productivity, promote transparency, and support Agile principles.

### Workflow Visualization
Our Kanban board consists of seven columns that represent different stages of our development process:

1. Backlog: Contains all upcoming user stories and tasks.
2. Ready: Holds fully defined tasks that are prepared for development.
3. In Progress: Shows tasks currently being worked on.
4. In Review: Displays tasks undergoing peer code review.
5. Testing: Indicates tasks in the QA process.
6. Blocked: Highlights tasks facing impediments.
7. Done: Showcases completed tasks.

This column structure allows us to visualize the flow of work from conception to completion, providing a clear overview of our project's status at any given time.

### Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits
To maintain efficiency and prevent bottlenecks, we've implemented WIP limits:

- In Progress: Maximum of 3 tasks
- In Review: Maximum of 2 tasks
- Testing: Maximum of 2 tasks

These limits ensure that we focus on completing tasks before starting new ones, reducing context switching and improving overall productivity.

### Supporting Agile Principles
Our Kanban board supports Agile principles in several ways:

1. Continuous Delivery: The board's flow from "Ready" to "Done" facilitates regular delivery of completed features.

2. Adaptability: We can easily reprioritize tasks in the "Backlog" and "Ready" columns to adapt to changing project needs.

3. Transparency: The visual nature of the board provides clear communication of project status to all stakeholders.

4. Collaboration: The "In Review" column promotes peer reviews and knowledge sharing among team members.

5. Continuous Improvement: By visualizing our workflow, we can identify bottlenecks and refine our processes over time.

Our Kanban board is more than just a task tracker; it's a dynamic tool that helps us maintain an efficient, flexible, and collaborative approach to developing our AWS Networking Services Learning Platform.
