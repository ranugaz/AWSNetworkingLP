Sprint Goal Statement:
This sprint focuses on delivering the core functionality required for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the AWS Networking Learning Platform. By implementing user registration, course search, basic content access, and course creation features, I will have a functional foundation that allows students to sign up, find relevant courses, and start learning. This sprint's deliverables will enable to gather initial user feedback and validate our core value proposition. The inclusion of both student and instructor-facing features ensures that I can begin populating the platform with content while allowing students to engage with it, setting the stage for future enhancements and refinements.
