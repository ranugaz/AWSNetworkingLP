# Branch Protection Ruleset Justification

## Overview
This document explains the branch protection ruleset implemented in  AWS Networking Learning Platform project and the importance for maintaining code quality and stability.

## Current Implementation

### 1. Restrict Updates and Deletions
**Rule**: Only authorized users can update or delete the main branch
**Importance**:
- Prevents unauthorized modifications to production code
- Ensures changes go through proper review channels
- Maintains code integrity and security

### 2. Require Linear History
**Rule**: Prevents merge commits from being pushed
**Importance**:
- Creates a clean, easy-to-follow git history
- Simplifies debugging and code review
- Makes it easier to track changes and revert if needed

### 3. Require Pull Request Before Merging
**Rule**: All changes must be submitted via pull request with at least one approval
**Importance**:
- Enforces code review process
- Ensures all code changes are reviewed by at least one other team member
- Creates documentation trail for changes
- Facilitates team discussion and knowledge sharing

### 4. Block Force Pushes
**Rule**: Prevents force pushing to protected branches
**Importance**:
- Maintains git history integrity
- Prevents accidental code loss
- Ensures all changes are tracked and reviewable

## Planned Enhancements
- **Status Checks Requirement**: Will be implemented after setting up CI/CD pipeline
- **Additional Review Requirements**: May be added as team grows

## Benefits for AWS Networking Learning Platform
1. **Quality Assurance**: 
   - Ensures all code changes are reviewed
   - Maintains high standards for learning content
   - Prevents unauthorized modifications

2. **Team Collaboration**: 
   - Promotes knowledge sharing
   - Facilitates discussion through pull requests
   - Ensures visibility of changes

3. **Project Stability**: 
   - Protects critical branches
   - Maintains consistent deployment process
   - Prevents accidental deletions or force pushes

4. **Change Management**: 
   - Creates clear audit trail
   - Documents decision-making process
   - Enables easy tracking of modifications

## Future Considerations
As the project evolves, we will:
1. Add required status checks once CI/CD pipeline is implemented
2. Adjust review requirements based on team size and needs
3. Implement additional security measures as needed
