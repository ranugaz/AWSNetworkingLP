**Challenges faced in balancing stakeholder needs in seperate markdown**

In developing the System Requirements Document (SRD) for the AWS Networking Services Learning Platform, several challenges emerged in balancing the needs of various stakeholders. This reflection outlines key areas of difficulty and potential strategies for addressing them.

## 1. Rapid Technological Changes

**Challenge:** The fast-paced evolution of AWS services makes it difficult to keep content up-to-date, affecting multiple stakeholders including students, instructors, and employers.

**Strategy:** Develop an agile content update system and establish a direct line of communication with AWS for the latest updates. Consider implementing a version control system for course content.

## 2. Resource Allocation

**Challenge:** Limited resources (time and budget) make it challenging to fully satisfy all stakeholder requirements simultaneously.

**Strategy:** Prioritize features based on a combination of stakeholder importance and feasibility. Implement an iterative development approach, addressing critical needs first and gradually expanding.

## 3. Security vs. Usability

**Challenge:** While platform administrators prioritize robust security measures, students and instructors value ease of use and accessibility.

**Strategy:** Implement security measures that don't significantly impact user experience. Use single sign-on systems and intuitive security protocols to balance these needs.

## 4. Scalability vs. Personalization

**Challenge:** The need for a scalable platform conflicts with the desire for personalized learning experiences.

**Strategy:** Utilize AI and machine learning algorithms to provide personalized recommendations and learning paths within a scalable infrastructure.

Assignment 5 Reflections:

- Experienceing test cases for the AWS Networking Services Learning Platform presented several challenges. The process of translating stakeholder requirements into detailed use cases. 
- Capturing Non-Functional Requirements: While functional requirements easily translated into use cases, incorporating non-functional requirements such as performance, security, and scalability proved more challenging. 
- I find it challenging to create tables formarts, when trying to modify it, it breaks. 
## Conclusion

Balancing diverse stakeholder needs in the AWS Networking Services Learning Platform has been challenging. However, by adopting flexible strategies, prioritizing effectively, I can create a platform that addresses core needs while remaining adaptable to future changes and requirements.
