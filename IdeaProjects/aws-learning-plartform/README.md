# AWS Networking Services Learning Plartform

# Project Title
AWS Networking Services Learning Platform

# Project goal
This Learning Plartform is designed to provide a focused, student system for learning AWS Networking Services. The Plartform aims to offer course access, content delivery, assesments and progress tracking to enhance the learning experience for students interested in AWS Networking.

# Project Structure

To complete the project setup:

*Assignment 3:*
Created a new repository on GitHub named "AWSNetworkingLP".
Initialized it with a README.md file.
Created two additional files: SPECIFICATION.md and ARCHITECTURE.md.
For the C4 diagrams, I've used Mermaid tool to create the diagrams and then insert the code into the ARCHITECTURE.md file.

*Assignment 4:*

Done stakeholder analysis and define detailed functional/nonfunctional requirements for AWS Networking Learning Plartform.

Files:
•⁠  ⁠Stakeholder-Analysis-Table.md
•⁠  ⁠System-Requirements-Document.md
•⁠  ⁠Reflection (Updated)

*Assignment 5:*
Translated stakeholder and system requirements into use case diagrams, detailed use case specifications, and test cases to validate system behavior.

Files:
•⁠  ⁠UseCaseDiagram.md
•⁠  ⁠UseCaseSpecifications.md
•⁠  ⁠TestCases.md
•⁠  ⁠Reflection (Updated)

*Assignment 6:*
Applied Agile methodology by translating system requirements and use cases into user stories, creating a prioritized product backlog, and planning an initial sprint.

Files:

•⁠  ⁠User_Stories.md
•⁠  ⁠Product_Backlog.md
•⁠  ⁠Sprint_Plan.md
•⁠  ⁠Reflection.md (Updated)

*Assignment 7:* GitHub Project Templates and Kanban Board Implementation Objective Analyze GitHub’s

Compared github project templates. Justified for choosing automated Kanban template. Have customized the template to add new columns.

## Kanban Board Customization

Our Kanban board has been customized to better suit the needs of the AWS Networking Services Learning Platform project:

1.⁠ ⁠*Testing Column*: Added to clearly separate tasks that are ready for or undergoing Quality Assurance. This ensures that our learning content and features meet high-quality standards before being marked as complete.

2.⁠ ⁠*Blocked Column*: Introduced to highlight tasks facing impediments or external dependencies. This helps in quickly identifying and addressing bottlenecks in our development process, crucial for maintaining the smooth progression of our learning platform development.

These customizations allow for better visualization of our workflow, ensuring that testing is a distinct phase and that any blocked items are immediately visible to the team. This supports our goal of delivering a high-quality, reliable learning experience for AWS Networking Services.

## Kanban Board

We use a GitHub Project Board to track the progress of our user stories. Our board is structured as follows:

•⁠  ⁠*Backlog*: All user stories that are not yet ready for development.
•⁠  ⁠*Ready*: User stories that are fully defined and ready to be worked on.
•⁠  ⁠*In Progress*: User stories currently being developed.
•⁠  ⁠*In Review*: User stories that are complete and awaiting code review.
•⁠  ⁠*Testing*: User stories undergoing QA.
•⁠  ⁠*Blocked*: User stories that cannot proceed due to external factors.
•⁠  ⁠*Done*: Completed user stories.

Files:

•⁠  ⁠Template_Analysis.md
•⁠  ⁠A screenshot of Kanban board, the file named "Custom Kanban board.png".
•⁠  ⁠Kanban_Board_Explanation.md
•⁠  ⁠Reflection.md (Updated)

*Assignment 8:* Object State Modeling and Activity Workflow Modeling Objective

Files:
•⁠  ⁠State_Transition_Diagrams.md
•⁠  ⁠Activity_Diagrams.md
•⁠  ⁠Explaination_for_StateChange_&_Activity_Diagram.md
•⁠  ⁠Reflection.md (Updated)

*Assignment 9:* Object State Modeling and Activity Workflow Modeling Objective

Files:

•⁠  ⁠domain_model_description.md
•⁠  ⁠Class_Diagram.md
•⁠  ⁠Reflection.md (Updated)

*Assignment 10:*  From Class Diagrams to Code with All Creational Patterns

1.⁠ ⁠Implement the classes in preferred language (Java)

Created all enums:
•⁠  ⁠ContentType
•⁠  ⁠UserRole
•⁠  ⁠AccountStatus
•⁠  ⁠CourseStatus

All model classes:
•⁠  ⁠User
•⁠  ⁠Course
•⁠  ⁠Lesson
•⁠  ⁠Content
•⁠  ⁠Quiz
•⁠  ⁠Question
•⁠  ⁠Progress

Each class includes:
•⁠  ⁠Private attributes
•⁠  ⁠Getters/setters
•⁠  ⁠Core methods from the diagram
•⁠  ⁠Proper relationships through composition/association
